# 30 Day Coding Challenge
Welcome to the 30 Day Coding Challenge! This challenge is designed to help you improve your coding skills by working on a coding project every day for 30 consecutive days. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this challenge will provide you with an opportunity to practice your coding, problem-solving, and software development skills.

# How It Works
Every day, you will work on a coding project of your choice.
You can choose projects from various domains like web development, data analysis, algorithms, mobile app development, machine learning, and more.
It's recommended to start with simpler projects and gradually increase the complexity as you progress.
Each project should be completed within 24 hours, but feel free to spend more time if needed.
You can use any programming language, framework, or technology stack of your choice.
Document your progress and code by creating a separate folder for each project.
Update the README.md file in each project folder with a description, installation instructions, usage examples, and any other relevant information.
Feel free to share your progress on social media using the hashtag #30DayCodingChallenge to inspire and connect with other participants.
# Getting Started
